# SMART DIY

## Description

Smart DIY aims to be a cheap and easy to use home automation system,
written with a combination of C++ and NodeJS. The usage of the WebSocket
standard makes the system easy to hack and open to anyone with basic
JavaScript knowledge.

**Project still in early development.** After implementing the first iteration
the software, I was unhappy with the performance and general design. This is
why I started a redesign.

**Documentation:**
Full documentation available in the "documentation" sub directory. More
information will be amended as development continues.
